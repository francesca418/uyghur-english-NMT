# Data Folder

This folder contains all of the data needed to train and evaluate models for this project. It also contains some extraneous documents that were necessary for purposes of pre-processing or generated as intermediate steps. 

It is best to refer to the Colab notebook, since this demonstrates the correct filenames for training and evaluating models. The Code and Output folder README.md files also contain instructions for how to evaluate on prediction files (though this is also contained clearly in the Colab notebook). 

Data obtained from [here](https://tatoeba.org/eng/downloads), though it is small enough that you should just be able to look at the files in this directory directly.

Details on the side of the data and other relevant information is contained in the final report document.
